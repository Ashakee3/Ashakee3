<h1>IT Ethics</h1>

<p>
As technology keeps growing and changing, it is really important for people in IT to think about ethics. 
IT professionals need to protect user privacy, stay honest about how data is collected, and try to avoid bias when building systems. 
Groups like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) remind us that the publicâ€™s safety and trust should always come first. 
By following clear ethical guidelines, we can make sure technology stays fair, responsible, and good for everyone.
